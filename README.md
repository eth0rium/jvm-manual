Go to <a href="https://github.com/WalmartSolutions/jvm-manual/wiki">wiki</a> for material.

# Why?
I made this because I felt like there were no good resources to learn JVM RE and my journey was difficult and took a while. <br>
This wiki packs basically everything you would need to know to reverse an easy to intermediate level **crackme**.

No, it will not teach you everything there is to know (obviously), a lot of things you will still have to learn yourself. <br>
For which I suggest reading the JVM specification.

# Disclaimers
This wiki is still not *finished* and won't be for a pretty long time which means you might see missing information or incorrect information, refer to the issues page for this.

I feel obligated to say that the author is not responsible for what the reader does with the information provided in this wiki, everything that is said in this wiki is only for educational purposes and isn't meant to teach people about how to commit theft of intellectual property or in more simple words "crack" software.

# Contributions
Contributions are completely welcome although there are a few requirements.
### Grammar
- You don't need to be an English major, occasional mistakes are fine but try not to make them.
- Having good grammar makes the information on the wiki more clear and understandable.
### Page length
-  A long page may overwhelm or bore the reader and prevent them from fully reading the information provided, to circumvent this you shouldn't make pages that are very long.
- Long pages are fine but try not to make it too long, use the existing pages for reference.
### Topics
- Avoid talking too much about topics that have already been **only extensively** covered, this is kind of redundant but I feel it should be mentioned.
### Ethics
- Should be common sense but try not to make this a 'how to crack software!!' type of guide, this wiki is for reverse engineering. 
- This doesn't mean you are limited to the amount of information you are allowed to provide but simply means that you shouldn't make a step-by-step guide on how to crack software.

There are obviously more but you should use common sense for those ones.
